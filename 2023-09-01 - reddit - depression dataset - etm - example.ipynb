I hadn't been to see them for a while because of her attitude, so I agreed to see her again.

As soon as they even suggested it I said it would be a waste of time, surprise surprise- I couldn't go to the building to learn, I couldn't cope with the home tutor they sent me, so they stopped seeing us. I'm not going to lie, I feel a lot stressed out now they've gone.\n",

No, I don't need to get more hobbies- No, I don't want to exercise, but thank you for making me feel bad about my weight- I've been doing all of that for at least 2 years and it did jack shit. \n",

He listened, didn't interrupt me, and seemed to know what he was doing- They counted that as a \"mental assessment\" which sort of worries me, If I knew that they were going to do that I would of mentioned a bunch of other things, I explained most of it to him and he mentioned that he wasn't really qualified to make any calls on things like disorders or medication, so it sort of irks me that they did that. But I guess it's too late to tell them that now)\n",

I was athletic due to 10 years of practicing martial arts, you could say i'm good looking, but thats it. Not the kind of good looking that gets girls. I'm shy with people i don't know, and it's hard for me making friends and getting to know people, I don't know if it is because i have no interest in random people, or i have little in common with most of them. I have a few friends, most of them female, and most of them since I was a 3yo. Most of the time crappy friends, who look nothing but for themselves and will try to act as if they are concerned about me, but really don't give a shit of what i need from them. I had family problems during my childhood, my father was an alcoholic, his company went bankrupt, and was somehow aggresive, but never hit us or anything, just shouted a lot and tried to show supremacy. my mother on the other hand was always sad and hysterical (which is normal i guess) and she could raise me and my brother some years alone, some with my father. Anyway, my father could overcome his problems and everything went fine when i was 18.\n",

Here the degree is 5 years, and the media to finish it due to it's difficulty is 7.5 years (exams have questions about things that weren't tought in class,like 1/3 of the exam minimum,  well, typical engineering). I could say i'm smart, i've been playing videogames all the degree, working half-ass, and had it almost finish in 6 yeras, now i have only left my final year project, where i'm working in a factory as a project engineer (its not really a job, just to do the project and get a little money, doing somebody elses work who doesnt have time to do it). And that's it. I'll finish this project, september or christmas, and i have no idea what to do in my life.

      "I've always had something dark inside me. suicidal thoughts, depressions, feeling alone mostly. I've never been a popular kid, had a very bad time until i was 14, cause i was fat and nerd. then i grew up, stopped being fat, jerks quit school, and life went better. After that i hooked up with a couple of girls, gained some confidence... High school was better, fell in love with a girl, finished hooking up with another one because i'm an idiot and ended alone and depressed. I even tried to kill myself during a trip, i felt really alone. \n",

      "Things always get better, college started (I lived at home during college), I wanted a girlfriend, and though i'm good looking no one seem interested. Until i found her. That moment she seemed a goddess. she was hot, but crazy eyes (great sex anyway). I got into a 2 and a half year relationship where i got fucking brainwashed, stopped being me, stopped doing sport,did everything for her (of course she had lots of problems), and almost dropped off college. She turned everyone against me, manipulated me, and when we broke up i tried to kill myself again, i didn't see an exit, everything was fucked up, had a big anxiety crisis, but when i was about to jump out that window (half body outside really) my father got me and brought me inside. Since then i had an awful recovery, got better in a couple of months, passed another subject (dont know how i made it), college started again (it was during finals) and things started to get better again.  People realized she was fucking crazy and got back my friends. I had to go through everything alone.\n",

She lived like 220 miles away and we visited each other like once every 2 or 3 weeks. I felt like i was giving everything for that relationship, and she wasn't.\n",
      " Anyway, I had my plans. Finish this project, go to her city to study a master's degree, or find work there, live with her or something. Now i'm finishing my degree, got no plans, no illusions, and no strength to carry on. \n",
